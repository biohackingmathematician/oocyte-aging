## Alternative Cell Types for Clinical Aging Biomarkers

### Granulosa Cells as Accessible Biomarkers

Professor's question: "Are there different cell types that could be 
correlated with oocyte age that are easier to collect?"

**Answer**: Yes - granulosa cells represent an ideal alternative.

#### Clinical Advantages of Granulosa Cells:

1. **Routinely collected**: Retrieved during standard IVF oocyte retrieval
2. **Currently discarded**: No additional procedures required
3. **Abundant**: Multiple cells per follicle vs single oocyte
4. **Reflect oocyte status**: Direct communication via gap junctions

#### Evidence from Literature:

- Chen et al. (2024) Nature Aging showed granulosa cells exhibit 
  age-related transcriptomic changes in human ovaries (GSE202601)
- Granulosa cell markers can predict oocyte developmental potential
- Age-related changes in granulosa cells precede oocyte changes

#### Proposed Future Work:

1. Integrate GSE202601 granulosa cell snRNA-seq data
2. Identify shared aging signatures between oocytes and granulosa cells
3. Validate granulosa-based biomarkers that predict oocyte quality
4. Develop clinically deployable granulosa cell aging panel

#### Preliminary Analysis (Oocytes Only):

Based on our oocyte analysis, top aging-correlated genes include:

These represent candidates for validation in granulosa cells.
