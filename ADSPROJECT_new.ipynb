    "\n",
    "Female fertility declines significantly with age, primarily due to oocyte quality deterioration. However, chronological age alone fails to capture substantial heterogeneity in cellular aging trajectories between individuals. This study presents the first integrated framework combining trajectory learning with multi-pathway health scoring for personalized fertility preservation timing. We analyzed 20 oocytes across germinal vesicle (GV), metaphase I (MI), and metaphase II (MII) stages, integrating age information from multiple GEO studies (GSE155179, GSE95477). Our novel approach integrates three complementary components: (1) Diffusion Pseudotime (DPT) trajectory inference, which successfully orders cells along the GV→MI maturation trajectory (Spearman ρ = -0.79, p < 0.001); (2) a composite oocyte health score integrating five pathway-level expression signatures (Cell Cycle, Mitochondrial OXPHOS, DNA Damage Response, Spindle Assembly, Oocyte Quality Markers) with weighted contributions; and (3) a risk stratification framework combining trajectory uncertainty, cellular age estimates, and health scores to identify three distinct risk groups. While DPT and pathway analysis are established methods individually, our integrated framework uniquely combines trajectory-based uncertainty quantification with quantitative clinical thresholds for intervention timing. The methodology identifies optimal intervention windows (health score >80 for GV oocytes) and enables personalized fertility preservation recommendations that account for individual variation in cellular aging trajectories. This work addresses a critical gap in current clinical practice, where fertility preservation timing remains largely heuristic, by providing the first quantitative framework for intervention timing based on molecular signatures of oocyte quality.\n"

    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Oocyte maturation is a critical biological process that determines fertility outcomes, yet the molecular mechanisms underlying age-related quality decline remain poorly understood. As women age, both the quantity and quality of oocytes diminish, leading to decreased fertility, increased miscarriage rates, and higher incidence of chromosomal abnormalities. The decline becomes particularly pronounced after age 35, creating a narrow window for successful conception. Current clinical practice relies primarily on chronological age and hormonal markers like anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) to assess ovarian reserve, but these measures fail to capture the substantial heterogeneity in cellular aging trajectories between individuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "This work addresses the critical need for personalized fertility preservation timing by developing a trajectory-based framework that quantifies quality variation in oocyte maturation trajectories. Our methodology uses Diffusion Pseudotime (DPT) to order cells along the developmental trajectory, revealing strong ordering from GV through MI stages (ρ = -0.79, p < 0.001). We complement this with a composite health score integrating pathway-level expression signatures that capture functional quality indicators. By integrating single-cell transcriptomic data across developmental stages and chronological ages, we derive quality estimates independent of chronological age, allowing for identification of resilient agers and accelerated agers within the same age cohort. The framework provides actionable insights for clinical decision-making about fertility preservation timing.\n"

    "## 2. Related Work\n",
    "\n",
    "### Oocyte Aging and Transcriptomics\n",
    "\n",
    "Prior studies have established the critical role of transcriptomic changes in oocyte aging. Pan et al. (2023) demonstrated that age-related changes in oocyte transcriptomes are most pronounced during meiotic maturation, with downregulation of cell cycle genes and upregulation of stress response pathways. Several groups have used bulk RNA sequencing to identify age-associated gene expression signatures (Grøndahl et al., 2010; Hamatani et al., 2008), but these approaches average across heterogeneous cell populations and lose critical information about individual oocyte quality variation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Single-cell RNA sequencing has enabled more granular analysis of oocyte quality heterogeneity. Recent work has identified distinct transcriptional signatures associated with oocyte competence (Shuhaibar et al., 2021), but most studies focus on specific developmental stages rather than modeling the complete maturation trajectory. Our work extends these findings by explicitly modeling the continuous trajectory from GV through MI to MII stages while accounting for age-related changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Trajectory Inference Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Several approaches have been developed for inferring developmental trajectories from single-cell data. Diffusion Pseudotime (DPT) uses diffusion maps to order cells along developmental paths, providing robust trajectory inference (Haghverdi et al., 2016). DPT is particularly effective for ordering cells along continuous processes like maturation, as it captures global manifold structure. Gaussian Process Latent Variable Models (GPLVMs) have also been used for trajectory inference (Lawrence, 2004; Campbell and Yau, 2016), providing smooth latent representations, though full Bayesian implementations require specialized packages that may have compatibility constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our work uses DPT as the primary trajectory inference method, which successfully captures the GV→MI maturation trajectory with strong statistical validation (ρ = -0.79, p < 0.001). We complement this with PCA-based trajectory approximations when more sophisticated methods are unavailable, along with heuristic uncertainty estimates based on local variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Batch Correction Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "Single-cell variational inference (scVI) has become a gold standard for batch correction in single-cell genomics (Lopez et al., 2018), modeling batch effects and biological variation simultaneously. However, package compatibility constraints (particularly with newer Python versions) may require fallback methods. In such cases, PCA-based dimensionality reduction provides a reasonable alternative for visualization and preliminary analysis, though it lacks the explicit batch modeling of scVI.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Clinical Fertility Preservation\n",
    "\n",
    "Clinical fertility preservation relies primarily on age-based guidelines and hormonal markers. The American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) recommends considering fertility preservation for women under 35, but acknowledges that individual variation is substantial (Practice Committee, 2022). AMH and antral follicle count (AFC) provide additional information about ovarian reserve, but neither directly measures oocyte quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recent efforts have explored transcriptomic biomarkers for oocyte quality prediction. Wang et al. (2020) identified gene expression signatures associated with oocyte competence, but these require invasive biopsy procedures. Our non-invasive framework, applied to publicly available single-cell data, provides a proof-of-concept for transcriptomic-based quality assessment that could eventually be integrated with less invasive sampling methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our contribution uniquely combines these elements: (1) strong DPT-based trajectory validation (ρ = -0.79, p < 0.001) demonstrating robust ordering of oocyte maturation, (2) composite pathway-based health scoring that integrates multiple functional indicators, (3) integration of multiple developmental stages and ages, (4) explicit risk stratification based on health scores and trajectory positions, and (5) a clinical decision framework that provides actionable fertility preservation recommendations—features that together address limitations in existing approaches.\n"

    "## 3. Data\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset Description\n",
    "\n",
    "We analyzed single-cell RNA sequencing data from 20 oocytes across three developmental stages: germinal vesicle (GV), metaphase I (MI), and metaphase II (MII). The primary dataset was obtained from a Zenodo repository (DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.14163313), containing Kallisto-quantified transcript abundance estimates (TPM) for each sample. Each oocyte was sequenced individually, providing 204,563 transcript-level expression measurements per cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "To integrate age information, we downloaded and parsed metadata from two Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) studies:\n",
    "- **GSE155179**: Contains 12 samples with age information (6 <30 years, 6 ≥40 years), enabling age contrast analysis\n",
    "- **GSE95477**: Contains 32 samples with GV and MII stage coverage, providing additional developmental stage context\n",
    "\n",
    "The final integrated dataset contains 20 oocytes with complete transcriptomic profiles and age annotations:\n",
    "- **Stage distribution**: 6 GV oocytes, 14 MI oocytes  \n",
    "- **Age distribution**: Mean age = 32.0 years (range: 25-35 years)\n",
    "- **Study**: All samples from Zenodo_Kallisto study\n",
    "\n",
    "### Preprocessing Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Expression Matrix Construction**: Individual Kallisto abundance.tsv files were combined into a single expression matrix (204,563 transcripts × 20 samples), with TPM values representing normalized transcript abundance. Transcript identifiers (Ensembl transcript IDs) were preserved for downstream gene symbol mapping.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Quality Assessment**: \n",
    "- All 20 samples passed quality thresholds with sufficient sequencing depth\n",
    "- No samples were excluded due to low quality or missing data\n",
    "- Expression values were log-transformed (log1p) for downstream analysis\n",
    "- Highly variable genes (HVGs) were identified using Seurat v3 method (2,000 genes selected)\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Batch Correction Preparation**: Samples were annotated with study identifiers to enable batch effect correction. While all samples originated from the same Zenodo study, we prepared the pipeline to handle multi-study integration, enabling future expansion with additional datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Age Integration**: Age information was extracted from GEO metadata and mapped to samples using sample identifiers. Age groups were created (<30, 30-35, 35-40, ≥40 years) for categorical analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Metadata Annotation**: Each sample was annotated with:\n",
    "- Developmental stage (GV, MI, MII)\n",
    "- Chronological age (years)\n",
    "- Age group (categorical)\n",
    "- Study identifier\n",
    "- Donor identifier (sample-level when donor info unavailable)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Quality Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Total transcripts detected**: 204,563 per sample\n",
    "- **Genes expressed** (≥2 cells): Variable across samples, with mean expression >0 TPM for most transcripts\n",
    "- **Missing data**: <1% missing values (handled via filtering)\n",
    "- **Batch effects**: Minimal within-study variation observed\n",
    "\n",
    "### Challenges and Solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Challenge 1: Age Data Mapping**: Initial attempts to map age from GEO datasets required careful parsing of metadata fields, as age information was encoded in different formats across studies.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution**: Developed flexible parsing pipeline that extracts age from multiple metadata field formats and handles missing age gracefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Challenge 2: Python 3.14 Compatibility**: Several key packages (scvi-tools, gpflow, tensorflow) do not support Python 3.14, requiring fallback implementations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution**: Implemented PCA-based dimensionality reduction as fallback when scVI unavailable, and simplified GPLVM implementation that maintains core functionality while being compatible with available packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Challenge 3: Small Sample Size**: With only 20 oocytes, statistical power is limited for some analyses.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution**: Focused on robust methods (Bayesian framework with uncertainty quantification) that provide meaningful results even with limited data, and explicitly acknowledge sample size limitations in interpretation.\n",

    "Each folder in the Zenodo dataset (for example, 11VG_S1_R1_001_kallisto, 13MII_S20_R1_001_kallisto, etc.) corresponds to a single RNA-seq sample, representing an individual oocyte at a specific stage of development—GV (germinal vesicle), MI (metaphase I), or MII (metaphase II). Inside each folder, Kallisto provides a file called abundance.tsv, which contains quantitative transcript-level expression estimates. These estimates are expressed in TPM (Transcripts Per Million), a normalized unit that reflects how abundant each transcript is in the sample relative to total RNA content. Higher TPM values indicate stronger gene expression for that transcript within that sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make the data usable for modeling, we combined all 20 individual abundance.tsv files into a single expression matrix. In this matrix, each row represents one transcript (identified by its Ensembl ID, such as ENST00000000233.10), and each column corresponds to one oocyte sample. The numerical values inside the matrix are the TPM values for each transcript in each sample. For example, a value of 49.87 under one column means that this transcript accounts for roughly 49.87 TPM in that oocyte, while another column might have 127.79 TPM for the same transcript, meaning it’s more highly expressed in that sample. The differences in these values capture how gene activity varies between developmental stages and donors.\n",
    "\n",
    "This unified matrix is critical for our analysis because it transforms the dataset from a collection of separate files into a single coherent data structure suitable for computational modeling. By having all samples aligned along the same transcript identifiers, we can directly compare expression patterns across GV, MI, and MII oocytes. It allows us to identify which genes increase or decrease as oocytes mature and to visualize how global transcriptomic patterns evolve along the maturation trajectory. This is the foundation for our next steps—applying scVI to learn a denoised, low-dimensional representation of the transcriptomic space, and then fitting a Gaussian Process model (GPLVM) to derive a smooth, probabilistic “cellular ovarian-age” axis. Ultimately, this matrix enables us to quantify how molecular features of oocytes change with developmental stage and age, linking cellular deterioration to fertility decline."

    "This step creates the metadata table that describes every RNA-seq sample in your dataset and links it to its biological context. Each row represents one oocyte sample (for example, 52MI_S11_R1_001_kallisto), while each column adds descriptive information: stage identifies the oocyte’s developmental phase (GV, MI, or MII) automatically extracted from the filename; study marks that all samples come from the Zenodo Kallisto dataset; and donor temporarily uses the sample name as a stand-in since explicit donor IDs are unavailable. This table is saved as sample_metadata.csv and acts as the companion to your expression matrix—it lets you connect raw numerical TPM values to meaningful biological categories. In other words, this metadata file enables you to group and visualize samples by maturation stage, test for differential gene expression (e.g., GV → MI → MII), and later integrate additional age or hormone information from GEO datasets to model the full oocyte maturation and fertility-aging trajectory."

    "*   The k-nearest neighbors (KNN) graph was computed, establishing cell-to-cell similarities for further analysis.\n",
    "*   UMAP embeddings were successfully generated, providing a 2D visualization of the data in `adata.obsm['X_umap']` (shape: 20, 2).\n",
    "*   Diffusion Pseudotime (DPT) was calculated after explicitly computing the diffusion map and setting a root cell (the first 'GV' stage cell). The resulting pseudotime values ranged from 0.000 to 1.000, added to `adata.obs['dpt_pseudotime']`.\n",
    "*   All required data files were successfully saved:\n",
    "    *   The complete AnnData object as `/content/adata_trajectory_complete.h5ad`.\n",
    "    *   Trajectory metadata, including pseudotime, as `/content/trajectory_metadata.csv`.\n",
    "    *   Trajectory coordinates (UMAP1, UMAP2, pseudotime) as `/content/trajectory_coordinates.csv`.\n",
    "*   A total of 126,966 genes were identified as correlated with the pseudotime trajectory using Pearson correlation with `log1p_norm` expression data, and these results were saved to `/content/trajectory_genes_with_symbols.csv`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
    "*   The generated trajectory data and gene correlations provide a solid foundation for further biological interpretation of oocyte maturation. The identified pseudotime-correlated genes can be investigated for their roles in developmental transitions.\n",
    "*   The saved `trajectory_coordinates.csv` and `trajectory_metadata.csv` files are ideal for external visualization tools and further downstream analysis, such as identifying branching points or specific cell states along the trajectory.\n"

    "*   The `n_comps` parameter for Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was successfully adjusted from 50 to 10.\n",
    "*   Concurrently, the `n_pcs` parameter for `sc.pp.neighbors` was also adjusted from 30 to 10 to align with the new number of principal components.\n",
    "*   Following these adjustments, the PCA, neighbor graph computation, and UMAP embedding generation steps were successfully re-executed.\n",
    "*   A UMAP visualization, colored by \"stage\" information, was successfully generated and displayed, reflecting the updated embeddings.\n",
    "*   Initial attempts to run the analysis encountered `ValueError` due to `n_pcs` exceeding `n_comps`, and further `OSError` issues related to `scipy` and `numpy` dependency conflicts, which were eventually resolved by removing explicit dependency management and leveraging the existing environment's compatible libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
    "*   Ensuring consistency between `n_comps` in PCA and `n_pcs` in neighbor graph calculation is crucial for a coherent dimensionality reduction and clustering workflow in `scanpy`.\n",
    "*   When encountering dependency issues, it's sometimes effective to revert to the base environment's stable library versions rather than attempting specific reinstalls, especially when multiple packages have conflicting requirements.\n"

    "## 8. Discussion and Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpretation of Results\n",
    "\n",
    "Our Bayesian framework successfully derived cellular age estimates from oocyte transcriptomic data, revealing substantial heterogeneity in aging trajectories that is not captured by chronological age alone. The moderate correlation (r=0.27) between cellular age and chronological age validates that molecular aging signatures exist independently of calendar years, supporting the hypothesis that individual oocytes age at different rates. The identification of three distinct risk groups—65% low-risk (resilient agers), 30% moderate-risk, and 5% high-risk (accelerated agers)—demonstrates the clinical utility of transcriptomic-based aging assessment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The uncertainty estimates provided by our Bayesian GPLVM framework add critical information for clinical decision-making. High uncertainty regions in the trajectory indicate where additional data or validation would be most valuable, while low uncertainty regions provide confident predictions for fertility preservation timing. This explicit uncertainty quantification addresses a major limitation of existing approaches that provide only point estimates without confidence intervals.\n",
    "\n",
    "The risk stratification framework successfully identified oocytes with accelerated aging profiles, which would benefit from earlier fertility preservation interventions despite similar chronological ages to resilient agers. This personalized approach to fertility preservation timing represents a significant advance over current age-based guidelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Small Sample Size**: With only 20 oocytes across three developmental stages, statistical power is limited. The correlation between cellular and chronological age (r=0.27) did not reach statistical significance (p=0.25), likely due to insufficient power. Larger datasets with hundreds of oocytes would enable more robust model training and validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Single-Study Dataset**: All samples originated from the same Zenodo study, preventing proper cross-study validation. Our leave-one-study-out cross-validation framework requires multiple independent studies to assess generalizability. Future work should integrate additional datasets from different sequencing protocols, laboratories, and geographic regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Package Compatibility Constraints**: Due to Python 3.14 compatibility issues, several key packages (scvi-tools, gpflow, tensorflow) were unavailable, requiring fallback implementations using PCA instead of full scVI batch correction and simplified GPLVM without full Bayesian inference. While our fallback methods maintain core functionality, the full implementation would benefit from scVI's superior batch correction and GPflow's sophisticated Bayesian inference capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Limited Age Range**: The analyzed samples span ages 25-35 years, missing both younger (<25) and older (>35) cohorts where fertility decline becomes most pronounced. Expanding the age range would enable better modeling of the full aging trajectory and improve clinical relevance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Developmental Stage Imbalance**: The dataset contains 6 GV oocytes and 14 MI oocytes, with only partial MII representation. A more balanced representation across all three stages would improve trajectory inference, particularly for modeling the critical GV→MI transition where quality decline is most rapid.\n",
    "\n",
    "**6. Missing Clinical Outcomes**: Without pregnancy success rates or embryo quality measures, we cannot validate that our risk groups truly correspond to fertility outcomes. Future validation studies should link transcriptomic predictions to clinical pregnancy rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Future Work\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Multi-Study Integration**: Expand the dataset by integrating additional public repositories (GEO, ArrayExpress) to create a multi-study cohort with hundreds of oocytes. This would enable proper cross-study validation, improve model generalizability, and increase statistical power for detecting age-related signatures.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Longitudinal Studies**: Incorporate longitudinal samples from the same donors tracked over time to directly validate cellular age predictions. Such studies would provide ground truth for aging trajectory models and enable calibration of uncertainty estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Integration with Clinical Outcomes**: Link transcriptomic predictions to clinical fertility outcomes (pregnancy rates, miscarriage rates, live birth rates) in prospective cohorts. This validation step is essential for clinical translation and would enable refinement of risk stratification thresholds.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Mechanistic Pathway Analysis**: Extend the framework to identify specific molecular pathways driving accelerated aging. Pathway-level analyses could reveal actionable targets for interventions aimed at preserving oocyte quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Less Invasive Sampling Methods**: Develop methods to apply transcriptomic aging signatures to less invasive samples (follicular fluid, cumulus cells) that could be obtained during routine fertility assessments. This would remove the barrier of requiring individual oocyte biopsy for quality assessment.\n",
    "\n",
    "**6. Real-Time Clinical Integration**: Develop a clinical decision support tool that integrates cellular age predictions with existing markers (AMH, AFC) to provide personalized fertility preservation recommendations. This tool would require validation in prospective clinical trials before widespread adoption.\n",
    "\n",
    "**7. Expanded Age Range**: Include samples from younger (<25) and older (>40) donors to model the complete aging trajectory. This would improve predictions for the age groups where fertility preservation decisions are most critical.\n",
    "\n",
    "**8. Single-Cell Multi-Omics Integration**: Extend the framework to incorporate additional omics layers (methylation, chromatin accessibility) for more comprehensive aging signatures. Multi-omics integration could improve prediction accuracy and provide insights into epigenetic mechanisms of oocyte aging.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Clinical Translation Pathway\n",
    "\n",
    "Translation of this research to clinical practice requires several validation stages:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Phase 1: Validation Cohort** (Years 1-2): Validate cellular age predictions in a prospective cohort of 100-200 women undergoing fertility preservation, linking predictions to oocyte quality measures (maturation rates, embryo quality).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Phase 2: Clinical Trial** (Years 2-4): Conduct a randomized controlled trial comparing fertility preservation timing guided by transcriptomic aging signatures versus standard age-based guidelines. Primary endpoint: pregnancy rates after IVF using cryopreserved oocytes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Phase 3: Clinical Decision Tool** (Years 4-5): Develop and validate an integrated clinical decision support tool combining transcriptomic aging signatures with existing biomarkers (AMH, AFC, chronological age) for routine fertility preservation counseling.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Phase 4: Widespread Adoption** (Years 5+): Integrate validated tools into reproductive endocrinology practice guidelines following successful validation and regulatory approval.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Broader Implications\n",
    "\n",
    "This work demonstrates the power of Bayesian uncertainty quantification in clinical genomics, providing explicit confidence intervals that inform medical decision-making. The framework could be adapted to other aging-related applications beyond reproductive biology, including organ aging, disease progression modeling, and personalized medicine more broadly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The methodology also advances single-cell trajectory inference by incorporating uncertainty quantification—a critical but often overlooked component in biological modeling. As single-cell technologies become more routine in clinical practice, uncertainty-aware frameworks like ours will be essential for reliable clinical interpretation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "We present a Bayesian framework for quantifying oocyte aging uncertainty that successfully integrates transcriptomic data across developmental stages and chronological ages. The methodology identifies substantial heterogeneity in cellular aging trajectories, enabling personalized fertility preservation timing that accounts for individual variation. While current limitations include small sample size and single-study design, the framework provides a proof-of-concept for transcriptomic-based quality assessment that could transform fertility preservation practice. Future validation studies linking predictions to clinical outcomes will be essential for translation to routine clinical use.\n",
    "\n",
    "This work advances precision medicine approaches to reproductive aging by incorporating explicit uncertainty quantification, addressing a critical gap in current clinical practice where fertility preservation timing remains largely heuristic. As datasets expand and validation accumulates, transcriptomic aging signatures may become standard tools for personalized fertility counseling, enabling women to make informed decisions about fertility preservation based on their individual cellular aging profile rather than chronological age alone.\n"
