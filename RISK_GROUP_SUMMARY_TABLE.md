# Table 1. Oocyte Risk Group Summary (Model Outputs)

This table summarizes **EVERYTHING your model outputs**:
- cellular age
- uncertainty
- health score
- clinical risk group

**PERFECT for ADS** because it is interpretable, biological, and summarizes your findings without repeating performance metrics.

| Risk Group | Cellular Age (z) | Health Score | Uncertainty (σ) | % of Cells | Biological Interpretation |
|------------|------------------|--------------|-----------------|------------|---------------------------|
| High Risk | Older (0.6-1.0) | 41-41 | High (15895 ± 0) | 5.0% | Aging MI oocytes; urgent intervention window |
| Low Risk | Young (0.0-0.3) | 58-77 | Medium (1181 ± 681) | 65.0% | Healthy GV oocytes, strong viability |
| Moderate Risk | Young (0.0-0.3) | 56-58 | Medium (1969 ± 344) | 30.0% | Transition from GV to MI; early aging signals |
